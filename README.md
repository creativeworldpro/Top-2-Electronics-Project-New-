In this project, we are going to make simple electronics project that you can make at home easily. Using this project you can easily decorate your home office and other places also. It is very simple and cheap electronics project. There don’t have any risk factor to make this LED light project.

To make this led light project, we might need some electronics component. Those component list have to been given below.

Component List : 
1.	Transistor – Tip 41C
2.	Transistor – BD 139
3.	Capacitor - 100µf/ 16v *2
4.	Resistor – 56 KΩ *2
5.	LED – DC 12v (Red, Blue)
6.	Power Source – DC 12v
7.	

Transistor Pinout – As usual this transistor also have 3 legs and these 3 legs have different names.

TIP 141c – Tip 41C transistor is an NPN transistor. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1st no leg Base, 2nd no leg Collector and 3rd no leg Emitter.

BD 139 – BD 139 is an NPN transistor. This time if we count it’s leg from left side, then 1st no leg Emitter, 2nd no leg Collector and 3rd no leg Base.


Circuit Connection  - 


First we connect both transistor emitter leg. Then we connect capacitor with the circuit. Connect one capacitor negative leg with Tip41c transistor Base leg and capacitor positive leg with BD139 transistor Collector leg.

Connect another capacitor positive leg with Tip41C transistor Collector leg and capacitor negative leg with BD139 transistor Base leg.
Now we connect 56 KΩ resistor with the circuit. Connect this 2 resistor with both transistor Base leg and connect both resistors empty leg.


There are two components to connect with the circuit. Now we connect LED light with the circuit. Connect red color LED positive leg with resistor and negative leg with Collector leg of TIP41C transistor. 

Now connect blue color LED positive leg with resistor and negative leg with collector of BD 139 transistor. 
It is the time to connect power source with the circuit. We connect DC-12v positive cable with both LED positive leg and connect DC-12v negative cable with both transistor Emitter leg.


Our circuit is ready for use. Just plug-in power and enjoy awesome effect of LED light.
